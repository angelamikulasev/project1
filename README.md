General Assembly Web Development Immersive Project 1

Travel Trax is a Ruby on Rails web application built to help you keep track of your travels, whether it be a daily adventure or a trip across the world.

## Problem and Solution
Problem
* When you travel, where do you keep track of your itinerary?

Solution
* Create a web application that allows travellers to note highlights of their itinerary without it being public.

## Overview
When a user is directed to the we application, they will be directed to a landing page, allowing them the option to signup or login. Once an account has been created and the user has logged in successfully, they will be rediected to a dashboard. 

Through the dashboard, users are able to add countries, photos and create blog entries. Each entry has a location and that location is associated to a country. Users are also able to view the places theyve travelled to on a map.
